This is always so hard for me. I don’t know if I’ve ever made it the full breath hold for even a minute. I don’t feel the peace and calm you all describe. I feel panic and anxiety. It makes me feel like I’m going to die. What am I doing wrong?,"['How’s it going buddy. I’m sure you might get different responses but I think they might all suggest that’s perfectly ok. I don’t want to undermine how scary it is because believe me. ITS TERRIFYING. My wife is a therapist, and she has taught me many breathing techniques…… none of them make my heart race make me feel like I’m gonna pass out or make my fingers and toes tingle like the wim hof breathing method. So the first time I did it I had that exact feeling. I thought we were going to do something calming and then I had to do these crazy breaths for 30 reps. If I had two pieces of real advice, they would be this. 1 don’t be afraid to breathe a little bit slower than he suggests. Usually I’ll do 25 to 27 breaths instead of 30. It just takes me a little longer to fully breathe in and then do a relaxing, exhale than he does, so I feel rushed and I start to panic breath. I decided it would probably be better for me to just do 25 more calm breaths than 30 panicked ones. So don’t be afraid to go at your own pace if you will. And #2 when you get to the final breath hold, try and only focus on two things if you can. All the feelings you have in your body and his voice. He tells you that if your heart is racing and if your body temperature is changing if your fingers and toes are tingling, that that’s ok. I struggle with anxiety and this helps me be able to have a better mind-body connection and overtime. You start to feel less anxious about how your body is reacting to these crazy breath workouts. There is also a Wim Hof breathing technique for beginners where she does 30 seconds than a minute than a minute and a half. Maybe try the 32nd one a few times and build your way up. Hope any of this will help you get a little more enjoyment out of this. Good luck all the love all the power. 👍', '@@cocodadon7245 thank you so much for this. I was starting to feel like I was the only one struggling based on how many people are raving about their calm feelings and success here in the comments. I usually feel pretty good and when I’m done but when it’s happening I just can’t get myself to calm down. I’ll definitely try your tip to slow my breathing down cause I struggle to keep up with him too. Thanks again!', '@@91agraham  awesome!! Glad I could help. Yeah it’s definitely hard balance of stress and peace lol. I feel the same way because he says in with peace and out with stress. But I always feel like my inhales are super stressful so even I don’t 100% feel like I’m doing it right. I’m getting there tho!', 'Never force the breath hold. If you need to breathe then breathe. The only thing you need to focus on is taking deep full breaths and with time the breath hold will come naturally. Not by force ❤', '@@Sandalwoodrk thank you. I try to never force it']",2024-04-05T12:27:43Z,@91agraham

"I hate that this is so overlooked and not trusted even though Wim has gone through the process of proving this is a legitimate breathing technique to regulate the immune system and stop illness. This guy was on Joe Rogan and Joe Rogan still resorted to taking all these crap supplements and medicines when he caught covid. I don't understand how Joe could know about this but still go to take medicine when he got sick. Was he even listening to Wim? I've been practicing this breathing technique since 2019 and have not been sick since then. Before that I used to get really sick once in the spring and once in the fall every year. No viruses, no infections, never caught covid even going around sick people. This works and the people that know about it should put more trust in it rather than reaching for medicine when they get sick.",['Nothing wrong with medicine\nYou can do both ❤'],2024-04-05T12:03:41Z,@azsegrxdhtfgvijnkomlewrhtg9508

If you're interested in contributing to a scientific study on the impact of breathing practices on health, I invite you to take a short survey, which will take about 1 minute of your time.

"I have struggled with major depressive disorder, adhd, and autism all of my life. These conditions usually have me bed ridden and suicidal on a regular basis. Today, I was suffering with a particularly strong bout of depression, overstimulation, and hopelessness when I decided I would try to do this breathing method and take a cold shower. Before I did it, I was feeling tired, hateful toward myself, and overwhelmed with life in general. After this exercise was over, tears started falling out of my eyes and I began to feel real emotions for the first time in a while. It’s almost as if those tears were stuck behind a dam of sorrow and fear, begging to be let out. Once I did this exercise, the dam broke and it felt wonderful. Thank you so much for creating this video and this technique ❤","['So glad it helped.

"I have a question! Not sure if this is the best way to get answers but lets see. 

I cant keep up with thia rhythm of breathing. It feels stressing, I cant breath this fast even if I try. What does it mean? It is a sign of nervous system shutdown? Are my lungs bigger than most? Is my diaphram tight? Or is it normal?

Holding breath after exhaling is way difficult to me. Holding the recovery breath longer is way easier, I can keep it up for almost a minute  even after that exhale hold (I can keep it up app. 30 sec). You note that breathing earlier is ok - but is there anything possibly risky for extending that recovery breath hold? I dont feel its bad, I just wanna make sure.

If you see this and reply, awesome! Thank you for all you do, have been coming back to your videos for years and hopefully one day I will join one of your workshops ❤","[""It's absolutely fine if you can't match his pace exactly, just get good quality deep breaths from the stomach and chest. Some people slow down the video"", ""There's nothing wrong with you, that's all perfectly normal. Those things take practice. Just don't worry about going the same speed as the video, focus on fully filling your lungs. And don't force the breath holds, just breathe when you need to. With time these will become much easier ❤"", 'Thank you both for responding!!! I obeyed by own rhytm now, focusing on full breaths at a slower pace and got a much more out of the practise, the tingly feelings, relaxation and more clarity - and was able to hold my breath for 75 SECONDS after the exhale (compared to 30 sec!!)

"A technical question:
From what I can see, Wim Hof breathing is hyper-ventilation. This stimulates the sympathetic nervous system and boosts adrenaline production.
As I understand it, what's beneficial is that adrenalin will temporarily increase a lot - much more than in the case of chronic stress. And this big increase in adrenalin will enable the body to regulate it better and bring it down to a lower level than before.

Am I right?
What do you think of this method for people whose adrenal glands have already been exhausted by chronic stress?","[""Boosting the sympathetic nervous system is right but not the increasing adrenaline as far as I know.\nAlso the breath holds boost the parasympathetic nervous system, so it's affecting both parts.

"Hello everyone, I did the Wim Hof breathing method during the pandemic for anxiety and I felt great. I literally don't know why I stopped practicing, probably because the anxiety was reduced by about 80%
However, about a week ago I had a panic attack while driving and I thought I was going to pass out, everything came back again, the feeling of anxiety, irritability, I was helpless for a couple of days. But I remembered what helped me then, Wim Hof breathing of course! I felt better immediately and was back to normal after 2 days of practicing breathing. The anxiety went down by about 50% after just a week of breathing, but yesterday I had a mini panic attack while driving again despite doing the Wim Hof method in the morning. Of course, I am aware that I just need to face it and continue with the breathing exercises and everything will be fine, I am interested in your experiences, whether your body ""resists"" or deliberately sends panic attacks when you treat it with breathing.

I used to do this exercise daily for a couple of years and it helped so much with my breathing as well as anxiety. I'm not sure why but I stopped my daily practice. I was feeling really anxious today and something told me to do this exercise. Part of me didn't want to sit still for 11 minutes but I did it anyway. I still felt anxious after the first round and wanted to get up and stop but I kept going and I'm happy that I did because I'm not feeling as anxious anymore.

"I love the Wim Hof Method Breathing! It is so simple yet effective.

You might have heard about the amazing teacher from Costa Rica called JuanPa who developed a revolutionary, new breathwork technique called Quantum Breath. It is a bit more complex and much more sophisticated than Wim Hof's technique. However, if you become an instructor you will be able to guide students to profound experiences.

JuanPa is reopening the doors next week to join the 12-Week Quantum Breath Certification program which was closed in the last three months. Only 100 of us are part of this program yet, so this is a unique opportunity to join to this revolution.
He is hosting a free webclass on Wednesday, March 20, at 2 PM US Eastern Time where he will talk about what the program includes, why it's worth it, the opportunities it offers, etc. 

Plus, anyone who registers for free will instantly get access to his paid program called Quantum Leaps Jumpstart ($97 value) which will be available until the date of the webclass. It is already worth just to sign up to receive access to that course as it is extra high quality and you can experience the power of Quantum Breath. It will blow your mind!

If your spirit is calling for growth, transformation, and community impact, I warmly invite you to explore this journey. You can register here: https://get.quantumflow.com/qbic-webclass-mar-14-2024-registration?am_id=dominik581",[],2024-03-15T17:50:40Z,@theawakenedmanxyz

Head last and only for 1-3 seconds, I don’t immerse my head unless I wash my hair, so it’s not every time, but I do put cold on my face each time.\nTip 3: focus on long calm breaths (and never do this Wim Hof breathing with the breath holds in the water, very important!)\n\n\nPS: Wim has here many Q&A videos if you have questions about both - they help a lot!']",2024-03-14T13:35:50Z,@rask7723

"I’ve developed this new style of breathing with Wim’s method. I call it’s “Jerm’s accordion breathing”. Sit Indian style. Then you empty your lungs and hunch your face over your shins bending at the abdomen. When you breathe in, you straighten your back upright with good shoulder posture “phooly” inhaling through both the nose and mouth. As you lean back you can feel the air start to fill your lungs and when your fully extended you should feel the upper cavity of your lungs full as well. When you bend back over you breathe out all the air and the actual movement helps push the air in and out. Kinda like an accordion lol.

"When my relationship ended, I felt like my world was crumbling around me. The pain was so intense that it was almost tangible, like a heavy weight pressing down on my chest. I didn't know how to cope, how to move forward, until I stumbled upon Wim Hof's breathing technique.

At first, I was skeptical. How could something as simple as breathing possibly help me through this agony? But I was desperate, willing to try anything to find relief from the relentless ache in my heart. So, with nothing to lose, I gave it a shot.

As I sat there, following Wim Hof's instructions, something incredible happened. With each deep breath, it was as if a wave of calm washed over me, soothing the turmoil within. For the first time since the breakup, I felt a sense of peace, however fleeting it may have been.

But I didn't stop there. I made a commitment to myself to practice this breathing technique every day, no matter how painful it felt at first. And slowly, but surely, I began to notice a shift. The pain didn't disappear overnight, but it became more manageable. I could breathe a little easier, think a little clearer.

What surprised me most, though, were the physical benefits. I had always heard about the mind-body connection, but I never truly understood it until now. With each inhale, I could feel tension melting away from my body, leaving me feeling lighter, more energized.

But perhaps the most profound change of all was the way it helped me reconnect with myself. In the midst of heartache, it's easy to lose sight of who you are—to become defined by your pain. But through this practice, I rediscovered my inner strength, my resilience.

Today, as I look back on that dark period of my life, I am filled with gratitude for the role that Wim Hof's breathing technique played in my healing journey. It wasn't a quick fix, nor was it a cure-all. But it was a tool—a lifeline—that helped me navigate the stormy seas of heartbreak and emerge stronger on the other side. And for that, I will be forever grateful.",[],2024-02-21T21:16:26Z,@Kayla-jn4hw

How could y’all survive a whole minute bruh i can’t breathe and im only like 15 sec,"['Practice, you’re gonna get there soon! It’s because you have enough oxygen in your blood when deeply breathe before, so you can easily make 1, 2 or more minutes breath hold when you’ve practiced enough. But make sure you also breathe properly before holding breath. No shallow breaths but deep ones into the belly and lungs. Inhales and exhales are not supposed to be like, squeezing every single inch of your lungs, just go with guidance rhythm. Besides, the length of your breath hold doesn’t determine the quality of the exercise. It’s beneficial regardless of the length of the breath hold. Do what you’re feeling comfortable with, don’t push it as Wim says. There is also a beginner version of this video, so maybe go with that one first:)', 'It also depends on the activity you do before this exercise; I’d say the more I am relaxed, the longer I can hold my breath. 1:30 minute is no problem and I haven’t been doing this that long to be a pro (just about a few days, and a year ago for some days). Idk if you move during the exercise but that also take some oxygen (like I urgently needed to scratch my nose🤣). You should be completely relaxed.\n\nBut everyone is different, so find your own comfortable limit and slowly go with it every day you’ll see how it will go.

"Guys!!! This is crazy! I did cold shower today after doing the breathing exercises for a week once in a day. I thought 30 seconds will be good for a start but it was a good 2 minutes and I STOPPED FEELING ANY COLD AND ACTUALLY MY BODY ENJOYED THE COLD! I was so surprised that my body literally neutralized all the “ugly cold” I thought I will be feeling first thing in the shower (it was cold for maybe 10 first seconds and then my body just started to warm itself as the cold continued). As he said “don’t think, just go” so I did with the cold shower and I can imagine how people feel in the cold water when they go outside - their body enjoys it!!! I think I discovered something amazing that I never discovered before. I used to do hot->cold water in the morning some year ago but stopped and I didn’t do the breathing so I always felt like I need hot shower before cold because I HATED cold in the morning. I hated the discomfort of cold. But now?! Wow, I want to do this daily!!! It’s like a miracle how my body reacts now! Maybe I also changed something in my mind after I decided I’ll just GO into the shower without any warm/hot shower before. I love it!!!","[""That's so great to hear, thank you for sharing here, your enthusiasm is contagious!"", 'Well done', '@@BabyteethMore Your comment made me smile!🫶😁 I know the key is to be consistent… And also, I’ve heard sometimes motivation isn’t there for our goals in general which is normal, so the discipline (self persuasion to JUST DO) has to replace it in times like that. This time, I won’t excuse myself from doing these amazing habits because “I have no motivation” or “I don’t feel like to do it” - we don’t need it all the time as long as we decide to control what the mind will do and not that mind and comfort controls us💪']",2024-02-19T10:51:45Z,@NicoleEivissa

But not heard of it lasting all day.', 'Me and my friend both had this during each session  for a few weeks when we started, but aferwards it stopped happening for both of us.', 'i think some chemicals/hormones are being released when you’re in stress or anxiety mode (you’re teaching your body somehow with this method to handle stress when it’s without oxygen, I can’t explain it but I believe that’s what it does so your body may feel like it’s not used to it). My dog used to have a bit bad smell of her mouth and salivating on her first New Year’s Eve and hearing fireworks (she was in a high anxiety mode and her breath is never bad in a normal situation). The following year she was more calm, and no smell anymore. It may work similarly with people.\nThe other theory may be your body is detoxifying as the oxygen reaches all places in the body and all the organs and cells are starting to work better.

"For others who also have been doing this everyday for years at this point - Has anyone changed up part of the video because you've found a different/better benefit? I find listening outside usually is most effective, sitting cross-legged. But sometimes, I hold my breath in round 2 from 13-25 (like we do for the 60/90 sec periods after each round), and then breath normally with the video for the last 5 until the hold. In the 3rd round, I hold it but for less. Maybe from15-23 breath count, and then I continue with Wim. For whatever reason, I find it helps me get to that place of nothingness that I search for when I meditate. 

I also am lucky enough to get a free gym membership because of child goes there for daycare, so I spend 25 a month to use a hydra bed at the gym that massages your back. My ""ritual"" is doing the 10 min Wim Hof video during my 10 minute massage bed session. It add's an extra element that helps the little muscles around the body really relax.

Thank you so much for your

I have been doing it for a year now. It helps me get through tough moments in everyday life.

Should I continue with trying to keep my breath for longer? And what is it good for?

"Hello everybody !..! Hello Wim !..!
It's amazing how you feel when you do it for the first time. I had such strong tingling in my whole body and fingers of course during the first round, then during second and third bit less,... it was on FEB 2021. Fantastic feeling. I knew right away, that it was a gamechanger !..!
Later on, next days and sessions you feel it less and less, but it just the evidence that body gets use to hiperventilation as for anything else. It's just the first shock and natural high. BANGER !..!

Another thing - holding your breathe. First time it's difficult to keep it longer than a minute, but on and on - I reached 3 minutes easily... !..!
I checked the options with push-ups. 30 inhales and after last exhale - I held the breathe and did 30 push-ups with no breathing. It was easier than with breathing... Magic... !..!
I was doing it due to my absence of alcohol and other stuff, meditation (as such) was cool but too weak for me. That was THE ANSWER for the prayers from my body...

Now mind this!!!
I returned to the sessions NOW after 2 years break due to the other issues in my life and remembering exactly what I should expect - the same tingling, BUT during third round of inhale/exhale I felt such a strong tightness of my lower stomach, that I had not felt ever before ...  unbelivable ...

I've always had an open mind for these kind of simple but efficient methods. My father every sunday (he's 88 now) goes hot/cold/hot/cold showers, his godfather used to do it the same. He was around 93 when he died - no diseases at all. He had lived through two worldwars ... YEAH !..!

Period. 
Thanks Wim, you are THE MAN. I hope you still enjoy Poland and Śnieżka Mountain !..!

Are the exhalations through the mouth or nose?,"['inhale with nose, exhale with mouth', 'Exhale through the mouth, inhale however it feels best for you (I personally inhale and exhale through my mouth while doing this exercise).', 'you could do whatever you’d like', 'I alternate, whatever feels best at the time.', '@@angie0876 People tend to overthink and overcomplicate this imho. I remember him once saying something like ""get the air in anyway you like, you can get it in through the ass for all I care."" 😂 On a serious note, other things are much more important, breathe in and out rhythmically and without a break, take really full breaths, don\'t do it superficially. You need to do diaphragm breathing while doing the exercise to really do it properly. Imagine you have two deflated balls in your body, one in the stomach and one in the chest. With each breath you inflate the ball in the stomach and then the ball in the lungs in one fluent motion. You might not do it correctly right away, but if you do a conscious effort and practice it, it becomes second nature.

Anybody got any tips for me? Whenever i keep up with the breathing pace i get too into my head and talk myself into a small panic attack because i convince myself that i‘m going to pass out/my heart isn‘t beating/i‘ll never be able to breathe again. And i don‘t know how to convince myself that i‘m safe.,"[""Yes, breathe at your own slower pace that feels natural for the time being. Only start keeping up with the pace of the guidance when it feels relaxed. May take some time, took me 2 weeks when starting I think. \nTo the other part, this might sound easier than done, but fear and anxiety are just reactions to a thought, Don't have the thought and here is no fear. Focus on your heartbeat or meditate, anything that works for you to either not think at all or replace the thought with one thats not scary whould prevent the fear. If you find something that succeeds in this during the breathing a few or maybe even one time the fear may disappear completely because you know your body can handle the exercise and there is nothing to fear"", '@@apocalypsed8 wow thank you for that amazing answer, that helps a lot!']",2024-01-11T11:06:51Z,@joey757

"Man! As a heavy smoker (trying to quit) I thought I coudn't pause for more than 20 secs and certainly not a minute, but I managed to do 50 secs. 2nd round, ""hold for 1:30"" I thought ""sh**, no way"", so I just closed my eyes and held it for as long as I could. Then I panicked and inhaled, looked at the time, there was just 4 secs left. Last round was easy and now I just feel euphoric! Thank you so much! Can't wait to try this tonight before sleep","['Well done!', 'Quit mentally first. Think about all the times u usually smoke and think about how youre not smoking these times and that it feels ok without smoking. \nDecide to quit mentally but dont set a certain timepoint or date for quitting. One morning you will feel today Im done and you will not smoke no more and be happy with it. \nOr set a date if that feels better? \n3-5 days of withdrawel is normal but do a clean cut and dont take other nicotine-products. Cause as long as taking nicotine theres a great possibility for going back to smoking. \nSorry for just chanting out this but I have limited time so I cant make a dialouge, but I hope my words will help you ❤', '@@Joe-bj7nz I read the Allen Carr book on quitting and after that I tried and failed. But a month later tried again and I was free of nicotine for a month, easily. But then I took a trip with smokers who were out smoking every 15 mins and thought ""what the hell, I know how easy this is, I can smoke with them these couple days"". Nope. It definitely wasn\'t, two more years have passed smoking and I\'m planning on reading the book again. And I thank you for your advice, will come in handy I\'m sure', '\u200b@@heirapparent4877 Yes I hear you. I have fallen back many times but now Im free since july -23 (from nicotine.. we got this very strong nicotine in pouches and as minced tobacco up here in Sweden that go under the upper lip.. called snuff.. or snus in native language). \nI started when I was eleven yo and also was a smoker many years.. think I quit smoking about 2013 cause of respitory problems.\nThey say quitting with snus is harder then quitting with smoking cause of the high level of nicotine.. but Im not sure.\nI tried quitting both several times during about 30 years.. and also tried reducing the amount to about 2 cigarettes a day or 2-3 pouches of snus..even one a day. \n And as long as I took ever so slightly amount of nicotine I would fall back hard and then it was years of not having a thought of quitting passing again. \nBut I did a ""hard stop"" (no nicotine at all) once or twice and had the record of over a year. \nBut this time I knew it was final and that I will never start again.. and I hardly ever think about nicotine.  Its just gone from my system and Im free.. cant even hardly remember how addicted I was to it.. used to wake up several times during the nights and take another snus sleeping with it. \n\nSo thats what I mean with quitting mentally first.. just go over every scenario when the smokes feels best and make peace with those moments not smoking. Feeling good without it. And also think on how good it will feel hanging out with smokers and being a role model showing them not smoking and being social and have fun without it.. hanging out with them when theyre smoking without being tempted. You will just be free from it and have all your health becoming stronger. \n\nAnd this breathing excercise will help both quit smoking and give you a great mental health🎉 \n\nAnd as a personal thought if you combine it with the cold exposure (as the other part of the wim hof metodh) u can start recovering most physical issues too. \nThat book sounds good too! \n\nBest of luck to ya.. u will make it 🎉', ""You're not a smoker trying to quit.

Can take a few weeks\n2) Stop for the moment if you feel anything uncomfortable, you will never have to pass out if you listen to your body's signals\nThis is in the end, a relaxation exercise, doing anything forced or that does not feel well is counterproductive to what it should achieve, also during the breathing fully relaxed all muscles and dont breathe too forcefully, it will make for an overall nicer experience"", 'He has a beginner breathing video that I started out with']",2023-12-22T15:54:17Z,@oceanones7943

Right now while you are holding your breath there are people dying in agony, others crying out in misery and grief and heartache. Others still are homeless, starving, freezing or going through unimaginable torture. In your backyard there are earthworms being torn apart by ants and in the Serengeti there are gazelle being brought down by lions. Life, as Buddha and others pointed out, is suffering. Yes, holding your breath stills the mind and gives a nice peaceful feeling, but do not make the mistake of conflating that with a silly hippy notion of life being beautiful.

This is what it takes to find a little sanity, calm, transcendence and even peace during this weird period. It will pass too into a better or more difficult time. We'll see but in the meantime as saint Seraphim of Serov said . . . 'Find peace and thousands around you will find their salvation'. Save yourself, find healing and peace for yourself then you can give and help others. This is the golden order. I'm not saying you can not also give out of your pain. Also I'm not saying to not help or acknowledge pain, misery, terrible & horrific events happening in other parts of the world and I understood your acknowledgement of them in the word 'weird'."", ""And yet life is beautiful.

I've been doing breathwork longer than Wim Hof has been alive and am well aware how pleasant it can feel. That is all it is though. Do not arrogantly and ignorantly fool yourself into believing there is anything mystical about it. In no way does limiting the brain's oxygen supply change the reality of a terribly cruel world. In essence, your 'advice' is nothing more than an appeal to selfishness, i.e. so long as *I* feel okay then 'life is beautiful'. Reality doesn't work that way and I would advise you to cut back on all that breathing you're doing and to start thinking instead."", ""@@iankogneeto4882 Life can be both beautiful and suffering at the same time, and that's precisely what Wim Hof teaches.

"LONG COMMENT ⚠️ 
 ❤️ 2 months ago I quit niquitine after nearly 20 years of smoking although the last 2 years I have been vaping not smoking tobacco but same in the sense ive been poisoning myself for a long time. Then 1 month ago I was in bed about to fall  asleep and I felt like something was stuck in my throat so I got up coughed drank water and basically had a full blown panic/anxiety attack and convinced myself something was wrong with me to the point i thought about hospital my amazing partner comforted me and held me til it passed and i got over myself. Then 2 weeks ago while eating dinner I choked on a crispy chip and felt like it was stuck in my throat the feeling of dread and panic set in again like the first time but now kind of justified i forced myself to cough I also beat my chest hard a few times I was stood up coughing while bent down with my head by my knees. I coughed and panicked to the point I was physically sick and didn't go back to finnish my dinner then next day all I ate was half a tin of soup and the day after that I barely ate again through fear. And ever since the second episode almost on a Dailey basis I have been having the worst waves of anxiety I've ever had in my life im still probably not eating as much as i should. Sometimes its simply because I still feel something like a slight pressure in my chest or a burp stuck in my throat on occasion (probs something to do with no longer smoking) but kind of feels like the first episode and its most days so it's been freaking me out causing heart palpitations at times and making me feel very uneasy. And sometimes I feel it comes on for no reason iv been to the doctors since to have blood tests done all was well and I'm waiting on an ecg. I've done this video for 10 days in a row now and I can do all the breath holds and follow the video there's been maybe 2 days where I've had to breathe a few seconds early on the last hold and some days i can pause to hold a few seconds longer. I feel its definitely helping me manage my anxiety and at the same time it gives me confidence in my body because if there was something wrong with me like my heart lungs or throat I wouldn't be able to do the whole video the way I am. I don't usually share this deeply but wanted to say how this video Is now my favourite part of my day it leaves me feeling strong and calm I'm thinking once iv done a month of doing it every day I'm going to try cold showers aswell. sometimes your head can make you physically feel if you give credit to negative thoughts and its confusing for me sometimes but wim hof is helping me in ways I didn't think possible thankyou for reading if you got this far all the peace and all the love  to you all ❤️","['That feeling afterwards just rocks doesn’t it!

"I am a recovered fentanyl and benzo addict of two years that has been on a journey of self discovery and healing.
I discovered Wim last month. Although I’ve experimented with cold showers and meditation in the past Wim’s videos have motivated me to be more consistent. 

After high school I was headed to college in Boston to study Neuroscience on a scholarship, but fell victim to drugs after being abused by a family member who was jealous of my achievements. When I got clean two years ago even though I wanted to go back to school I felt incompetent because of all the damage done to not only my brain, but my soul. 

Well, I’ve been following Wim’s techniques for about a month now. Daily cold showers, and breathing… I can’t begin to explain the liberation I’ve felt. Tears of happiness flow from my eyes as I write this — I just enrolled in college yesterday, and I WILL be getting that neuroscience degree I’ve always dreamed of since I was a young girl.

These methods have relit the fire in my soul. I feel at peace, and powerful at the same time.

You’ve changed my life, Wim. Thank you.

And to everyone else : YOU CAN ACHIEVE ANYTHING YOUR HEART DESIRES!!! I believe in you. 

Love you all!!!","[""Thanks for Sharing!!

Im also a singer so I had to stop expressing myself. Though it has been a long and extremely humbling journey, I find myself coming back to the wim hof method and it brings me to tears how well it works. The breathing almost activates my deeper strained muscles and relaxes them. I’m on top of my breath and my life, which in turn has given me the strength to recover. The breathing has also helped my singing and I’m beginning to write and record songs again like I used to before my injury. There is hope for everyone.

"I’m wondering if I accidentally did some minor brain damage to myself. I’ve been doing Wim Hof for over a month now. I’ve gotten good at ignoring the urge to breath. Curious, I tried to push myself during a breath hold, and go for over two minutes. I could feel a sort of euphoria come over me, so during the next breath hold, I tried to go even longer.

I got this feeling of being submerged. I had gone for two and a half minutes. Realizing this, I let go. My ears were ringing. The back left part of my head, right next to my spine, had this weird sensation. I was quite panicked. 

Did I do some weird brain damage to myself? Did I shave off an IQ point or two? Have I forgotten a precious memory that I now don’t know I even had?","['Im no expert, but I think from what you write, Its your thinking brain wanting to be in «control» and want to make sense of everything and try to «protect» you.', 'honestly man , i think you might have cause some problems , better safe then sorry get it checked out as soon as possible', 'No you didnt lose any memories or iq lol. The wim hof method to some can give you tinnitus which is your ears ringing.

Bin doing this after having trouble sleep/anxiety. Works great. Only now after 2 months the sleeping problems are back and it looks like the breathing technique doesn't work anymore. I even felt more anxiety after. Anyone has the same experience? Maybe better to stop for a while?,"['Anxiety comes from negative belief systems and possible trauma. Do two rounds of wim? Try ice baths, up your magnesium and tell yourself how awesome you are ALL DAY until you believe it! ❤', ""\u200b@thecrystalgecko thx for the reply. Sorry but anxiety doesn't only come from negatieve belief or trauma. If it was only that 'simple'."", ""The effect of the exercise rises and falls with how you do it. If you dont let your mind wander, so meditate or focus on heartbeat during and fully relaxed your muscles, especially between the shoulders and around the heart area the effect will skyrocket. But sometimes we are too stressed and our hearrtrate is so elevated that it can be harder to control, I would recommend to not follow Wim's breathing speed in that case but breathe slower at a comfortable tempo for you, this will usually prevent raising your anxiety. Alternatively, if you have to come from a very stressed state adding rounds to the 3 can also really help, because for instance you can be as relaxed after 3 rounds as you normally already are after 1 or even before starting, but adding 2 extra rounds can in those days still get you to the desired state you normally get after 3 (sorry for rambling)""]",2023-10-12T07:49:03Z,@stefanvandiepen6476

A lot of negative attention is given to the hyper-oxygenation as being bad because usually, when we hyper-ventilate we are in a stress filled response which tightens our veins and when this happens with hyper-oxygenated blood it can lead to things like strokes and aneurisms.

"….And day 3 of my cold bathing and breathing. I did not have ice ready this morning as we are at our camp and got here late. However, even with the cold water bathing I still felt that same hesitancy to submerge so I refocused on my breathing and eased into the water and 2 things struck me as odd. I felt every bit of the cold as I did in my ice bath? AND, I hesitate to add this but all 3 times now I have felt an incredible urge to tee-tee (southern girl here☺️) as I did with or without the ice. Not sure why that is however I could hear Wim saying “release your troubles to the cold and embrace it’s healing power” so I did and I felt an instant emotional release. 🥲

"An amazing man. Scientists and doctors and philosophers should all collectively resign their jobs and study Wim Hof fulltime. They might actually make some progress in their fields...the type that benefits humanity instead of a few undesirables. 

Here is my challenge to myself. I am 57 and i have nothing and everything. As a child i suffered extreme sexual and mental abuse and have never had the courage to acknowledge it let alone resolve it. 

I tried suicide a few times and failed with great flair even when i drove my car at 90 mph into the central reservation of a motorway, rolling three times before ascending a grass embankment finalling landing on the car roof. I walked away, literally, with cuts and fractured ribs and returned to my work the following day. NB: I waited until 2am for the motorway to be clear of other cars. 

Since then, crippled with self disgust, crushing anxiety, i have worked and worked and married three times over. I self medicated with obssessions and anything else that would divert my attention. 

I worked bullshit jobs that make other people richer and that barely serviced my accumulating debts and obsessions. 

And then at 50 i found myself struggling to find regular work despite recommendations and referrals from many ex bosses and colleagues. 

So here i am at 57. I live in a room in my sisters house. I have no job, no possessions left to sell. I am diagnosed with three so called 'disorders' and taking prescribed stimulants and anti depressants which do not work but are incredibly difficult to kick because the withdrawal effects are severe. 

I was once an incredibly strong boy. Mentally able to bury the damage of the sexual abuse and physically very fit   thanks to the allconsuming sport of competitive swimming. I swam 15km per day 6 days a week and held records at county level. I trained harder than anyone else and despite incessant bullying (i was skinny and due to my metabolism unable to gain muscle bulk) i never stopped and i beat the bullies in the pool. 

But at 15 i stopped and the nasties from my past finally found a crack in my armour. And the depression, the mood dysregulation began. 

So now here is my challenge to myself. I am doing this for my twins who i love more than anything so that i can provide them with proof that we are all capable of achieving what others might claim to be impossible. 

One year from now i will no longer struggle to get out of my bed, no longer burn myself, no longer want to die, no longer need to live with family, no longer be addicted to pharmaceuticals. And more important than anything, i will be actively contributing to the good of humanity, making an intrinsic, positive, contribution. I have no idea how to do this but i will find the strength i had when i was a boy and i will achieve it one way or another. 

Thanks Wim Hof for the inspiration.","['This hit home thank you for sharing. Breathe and go into the cold everyday. The pain from your past are only old subconscious beliefs.

"I'm gonna try to work up to the full round, but for now I could do maybe half. So, 15 to 20 breaths, and 30-60 seconds pause. See, I had anxiety attacks for over 20 years, quite crippling at times, and the anxiety was always, always centred around breathing and my heart. Its pretty common with hypochondria, as I understand. Now, I got rid of my panic attacks by changing my diet, which gave my back my life, but in a way the anxiety is still there, under the surface. I think challenging it with this sort of exercise could help. I;ve just done the exercise for the first time just now, as I mentioned not to the full extent. I was worried it could trigger an attack, but it didn;t at all. In fact I feel pretty damn good! I will go further next time.","['Good Luck', 'That’s amazing!  FYI there is a beginner video.

"9 months ago I left a comment/update on here and I think it’s time for another one because what I have learned now may help others 

So now what I have discovered was my mindset or awareness of self was wrong going into this. I would come into this thinking by doing this would fix all my anxiety and be able to attack life and be a super human, but that is not the case. Yes I still use this and before when I was doing it it allowed me to get grounded and calm my mind for the time , but the main thing I had to do first was to radically accept my own reality and love all of it for what it was knowing that this life is mine to live and my past or my circumstances right now are just things I can learn from. So before when I wouldn’t accept my past I would do this and I would be upset later on why my meditation practice wasn’t fixing me. The answer was there was nothing to fix so I was fighting my own reality. So for people who are feeling like they are stuck (and I’m no expert but this helped me start my true healing) try to learn self acceptance and the big thing is once you do accept yourself know that the feelings and the problems will still be there but your mindset towards them can shift and then you can start to grow and forgive yourself older self for not knowing any better at the time. 
Now I use this exercise as a tool to help me ground myself and I see it as a privilege not a must have to. All these tools like meditation exercise nutrition therapy all this are not things that will “fix” you but rather tools to help you clear the mind to see your reality. So be patient and take a step back and accept you right now for you and say okay let’s see where I can go never wishing anything was different but rather stepping forward only in the best direction","['I salute you for what you have written and what you’ve been through.

"I am an extremely anxious person, and as much as I would say I have dealt with my past, my trauma, it still comes back up and there are still triggers there from a good few years ago. 
I had full body shivers during this and seriously felt a release.
I felt proud of myself and my body, for not only taking this step, but for getting me through this meditation.
I realised how blessed I am, and you are, just to be able to hold my breath for over a minute. 
Even if you sometimes don’t feel lucky. The fact you’re even alive to feel such ways, and you’re still being woken up in the morning is something. Even if it’s not a lot, it’s something.
I feel endless amounts of gratitude for what my body does for me, and it hurts me to know how hard we are on ourselves and our bodies.
We don’t always focus and recognise the little things our bodies do for us daily. Even if that’s just waking us up in the morning! 

My hands still feel so relaxed now, typing this feels weird😂.

"[Day 1 of NoFap]
Day 2 of NoFap, second time trying after breaking a 700 day streak
Day 3 of NoFap, going strong.
Day 4 of NoFap, hardly any urges so its really easy at this point of my journey. I think it'll get more difficult as my life gets more difficult (currently on holiday so minimal stress).
Day 5 of NoFap, went to a temple yesterday though I'm not religious or anything. Urges haven't really been effecting me. Socialising and excercise has been helpful. I am getting better at skateboarding, but it really hard.
Day 6 of NoFap, getting some urges, but still going strong. This little journal that I have going is helping a little, its better than the videos I used to make.
Day 7 of NoFap, did a workout last night and went skateboarding. First workout in a long time. This NoFap streak doesn't really feel like the other ones. Neither the urges of the benefits are really evident, so it feels a little easier. I do want to socialise more though, I hangout with friends every few days, but I think I have to make some new friends.
Day 7 of NoFap, I'm feeling a lot better than I did before I started this streak. At my MMA gym I've begun socialising a bit more, I've some progress to specific skill I'm working on and I have also just felt better in general. I don't know who will ever read this or why, but I've learnt a really useful idea recently which is to not follow on the foot steps of great people or people who you admire, but rather to seek what they sought. So, if we are to do this with some people who we look up to and individuals that do NoFap. Don't just blindly do NoFap because they did it, but realise that the true reason and the thing that they are doing NoFap is to have inner-peace and become better, kinder individuals. Remember you have no enemies.
Day 8 of NoFap, not much to say its just my 8th day.
Day 9 of NoFap, figures out I passed my semester in university after having initially failed a critical subject. I'm going to start private tutoring now (self-run) so hopefully that turns out well. I have to spend more time with my family tho.
Day 10 of NoFap, going well.
Day 11 of NoFap, some urges here and there, but overall pretty good. I woke up the earliest I have (without an alarm) in a while which was around 9:30pm. I finding that doing physical excercise such as bjj helps me sleep better at night. My phone and a laptop is an addiction at night though. Overall my life is improving, but I need to make some money, because I'm currently not working and am just spending. Which means that in a while the little money that I have in my savings will deminish.
Day 12 of NoFap, the reason is really hard to describe, but I've been waking up a lot earlier since starting my NoFap streak and have been sleeping earlier too. As in I wen't from waking up at 12:30pm to waking up at 10:45am, then 9:45am and today 8:45am. This is all without an alarm. Obviously with an alarm I can wake up whenever I wish, however, this was really surpising. I have a lot more time in my day now.
Day 13 of NoFap, did a BJJ and MMA class in the afternoon and in the morning I did a driving lesson which I did terrible in and couldn't really park properly and had a few other problems. Trying to start a tutoring business so I'm researching that. I socialised with some people at my mma gym which was nice. I've also made plans to hangout with two of my friends on Sunday. NoFap isn't really too difficult as of now. I'm trying to make each day count, rather than focussing on the streak. I moved my phone, laptop and iPad out of my bedroom so hopefully that makes me stop associated my bedroom or more specifically my bed with porn and masturbation. Other than that nothing too special about today.
[Day 14 of NoFap - no journal]
Day 15 of NoFap, I don't really care about my streak anymore. Had a wet dream which is kinda weird to talk about, but it is what it is. I'm starting to identify some deeper issues I have for the first time and I believe that they may be the cause of me watching pornography.
Day 16 of NoFap, no longer feeling like doing this commenting thing. still doing nofap, but this is kinda a waste of my time. i'll update if i relapse.
[Update 13/9/23] - still going strong not that anyone cares. I have a job now which is great and it means I can start investing some of my income.

"I have been practising the Mindfulness of Breathing technique https://www.youtube.com/post/UgkxIIDVgnLN8pF_fPOyoZ1nTjbLvvZcib6r as taught in this CD for about 2 years having read about it in Paramananda's  Change Your Mind  book and taken a real liking to it. However at times I struggle to remain focused on the breathing and thought that at such times this guided version might suit me. So after two years I finally decided to buy it! The first 7'24  of Track 1 of the CD is a body relaxtion which I do not use: I don't like body relaxation techniques and I find 27' just a little too long for meditation. The remaining 20' of gentle, guided meditation helps me tremendously to relax and stay focused. I find him's voice very soothing and whilst he is present to guide you through the 4 stages of the meditation, his presence is not intrusive or distracting. For the past two years I have tried to follow this technique as best I can with gentle meditation music despite music not being recommended. Having used this CD a couple of times I think I will try from now on to adopt a new routine of no music and just this CD as I find it so helpful. I realise now that the music really is distracting and I have enjoyed listening to the ambient sounds around me which I am normally unaware of. I can not comment on the other 2 tracks of Metta or Walking Meditation as I bought the CD solely to help me with the Mindfulness of Breathing and it does just that - very effectively. In my opinion this CD is money very well spent as it will guide you through a thoroughly useful and beneficial meditation technique and I don't think you can put a price on that.",[],2023-06-08T09:36:52Z,@jenelmarian9946

idk why but i cant hold the breath,"[""Don't worry man. It's about not being stressed. If you need to breathe, breathe. But in the first 30 breaths, make sure to keep them powerful and full. You are expelling the excess carbon dioxide from your body so you can hold your breath without worrying about the pain of carbon dioxide buildup. After that, just trust that your body will not be harmed and let go. Feel the things happening in your body as you hold your breath. The way blood flow is directed away from the extremities to conserve oxygen, how your heart begins to slow down, the way your fingers and toes feel after the blood has left them. It feels good.""]",2023-05-28T18:58:33Z,@raddyx5873
Can this help before running?,"[""It depends. Maybe not directly before, but it will definitely build up carbon dioxide tolerance if you progressively overload the time you hold your breath. Carbon dioxide tolerance helps you run long distances without needing to breathe as much, and it increases the acidity of your blood which causes more oxygen to be used. So if you run long distance, that's a big plus.""]",2023-05-28T17:23:30Z,@fernandolopezdeayala2069

"my second day doing this in bed first thing , i actually did the beginners one and then this one in a row. 

i got up to the full 90secs today (once) 

yesterday after my breathing and my cold shower , 

i was walking into town on a lovelly sunny day and it felt extremely similar to the days after i had my first DMT experience, the colours of everything were much more vibrant especially greens, the patterns and fractals within leaves and plant life was extraordinarily more sharp in focus and the way birds flew and seemed to just cut through the air on a predetermined pattern , so graceful and beautiful.

a long time (life) sufferer of anxiety , depression and low self esteem , i’ve been on so many meds on and off over the years. 

there’s definitely something to this , i mean i could feel it working from day 1 

our friend group lost two friends to suicide in the last 10 months , both beautiful young girls in their 20’s , the most recent one was 3 days ago😢

this method is really helping me cope and get on with the day to day .

"Edit2: I've been doing daily this for a while, and I notice sometimes after the breathing exercise I hear a tinnitus sound. It has always gone away, but I've seen posts on reddit from people claiming to have developed constant tinnitus from this breathing exercise. Since I need my ears and can't risk it, I have to stop doing the exercise at all. I haven't been properly trained in how to do this and I don't know the science behind tinnitus and the breathing exercise, and as long as both of those things are the case I cannot risk doing the exercise.

I finally got around to starting this. I surprised myself by going 1.5min on empty lungs. If I can find this comment after a month of doing this exercise each morning, I'll update with results. Also, in case you aren't aware, the left arrow key brings the video back 5 seconds making it easy to measure how much extra time you give your breath hold.

Edit: I've been doing this for a month now. The main things I notice are that I can hold my breath on empty lungs for at most about 1min50sec, instead of the 1min30sec limit I had before I started this. I also notice it's a bit easier to breathe through my nose when going to sleep (nasal breathing is good for you, and mouth breathing is bad). I will continue to do it and if in the months ahead I notice any differences I'll edit this comment.","['In up to 4min', 'Hey']",2023-05-20T15:34:15Z,@wiggles7976

when you hold the exhaled breath for 1:30+ and then you breathe out another cup of air!!  Compression?  Excess oxygen in the cells?,"[""Your lungs still have air in them even when you exhale, unless something happens like a lung collapse. Sort of like if you fill a tub  with gallons water, scoop out a quart and then dump in a fresh new quart - there's still lots of the old water there, mixing in with the new water. James Nester's book Breath is a great way to learn more about how a lot of this stuff works, like why you're actually building up more CO2 during this and why that's a good thing.

"Been doing this practice for 3 months straight, I love it. So calming before I start work or to decompress after a long day or work out. I want to make a couple notes I made that someone may find useful.

1. Nose breathing really elevated this practice for me. I do nasal inhale and mouth exhale strictly now, it took a bit of time but I can do much longer breath holds now and have an overall better session. 

2. I do 40 breath reps instead of 30. I just scan the video back a bit after I hit 30 breaths. This also helps with holds and getting oxygen into your lungs.

3. Some days are easier then others. Practice really helps but some days are more difficult, don’t get discouraged. I also think it’s great to pro long the sessions if you’re feeling it. I like to usually do 4 to 5 full parts instead of 3 in this videos. Just like the breath reps I scan the video back after I complete to get in another one or two sections.

This method has been a game changer for my mood and productivity! Thanks Wim 🙏",[],2023-05-10T15:18:50Z,@kelley2098

hi. i just started doing this a few days ago and i have a question about breathing to the more experienced people. after each round i feel something that i can describe as a sensation of vibration in the body and the more rounds i do the more it gets stronger and stronger. and if i do more then five rounds i also start to feel like the body starts to go numb and it is difficult or even almost impossible to move my fingers. so the question is - is that all normal reactions and what will happen if i will go on breathing after a numb state and is it safe?,"['If you only started a few days ago maybe you are doing too much too soon. Stick with three rounds for now to let your body adjust.', 'As wim says, Get high on your own supply. As long as you feel okay, i think it’s fine, just don’t push too much. Good Luck', ""here's what i've found out: the increasing vibration in the body / tingling sensation is a normal reaction in breathing techniques associated with hyperventilation. the numbness of the body is also a normal reaction in a longer sessions of such practices like holotropic breathwork. \n\nit is the result of decreased levels of carbon dioxide in the blood caused by hyperventilation. when the levels of CO2 in the blood drop, PH levels increase and become more alkaline. carbon dioxide acts as a vasodilator, meaning it keeps your veins open, so when your CO2 levels drop, your veins contract - which causes numbness and clamping sensations experienced in the hands. As CO2 aids the release of oxygen into your blood, your oxygen levels also lower. \n\nso my guess is: if to go on breathing after the numb state it may bring to the effects similar to holotropic. considering Wim's talk on DMT releasing.""]",2023-04-26T16:52:02Z,@seaocean6121

"Would Wim Hof breathing help afib? (After 2 weeks of thinking and doing) It should as it helps with vascularozation and O2.
The best time for me is on a treadmill at a brisk walk. I could hold my breath barely 15 seconds. Now I'm up to 20 seconds easy. When I'm light headed, I put my feet on the sides and rest. After 2 weeks I can tell a difference. The cold showers help also.  According to Wim as I understand  him, the cold showers tone the vascular system. This makes it easier for the heart to pump blood through the body (very important if you have Afib). So the heart slows its beats per minute (very important if you have Afib). I've done the cold showers for about 2 weeks. I think I detect a slower heart rate. Challenging to tell with an Afib beat,  but I think it has slowed some.
I took a break and came back
 I am definitely holding my breath longer. From studying it seems I am copying workouts at Altitude, which, per Dr's,  increases red bone marrow (At my age 68, most of my marrow is yellow fat marrow). Per the Dr's, red bone marrow produces more stem cells. Good for old folls.

"I have a question for all you amazing people doing the breathing exercise everyday. 

I have been doing the Wim Hof method for going on about 2 years now, and I've only made it to 2:17 ONCE. And to be honest, I was distracted by Wim talking (on the app the first time), and wasn't thinking about how long it had been. That seems to be what pulls my brain back to thinking most of the time. (How long has it been?) It's a fraction of a second thought, but it snaps me back to trying to hit an imaginary mark, and therefore, thinking, about the times. And it messes with my state of, not thinking? Presence?  I don't know what to call it lol  My avg breath hold (retention) based on what the app says, is anywhere from 1:30-1:45. I usually get 2 minutes on round 3 almost every time. (The last round) Also, I'm doing the BREATHING before bed (3 rounds, 30 breaths) and in the morning. (3 rounds, 30 breaths) After experimenting with more rounds for a while & more breaths, That's what feels good to me. (No forcing) I've been doing it twice a day for about 6 months, but at least once a day for almost 2 years. I also take an ice bath EVERY DAY. In the morning after my breath work. For about a year now. I'm up to about 10 minutes every morning. 

The myriad of benefits I have come across are almost too long to list. I won't do it here, I'll spare you all lol 😆 this is already long as hell & I'm assuming you know most of them anyway. 

All that to say, I want to improve my holds/retention times. I wanna hit 3 minutes. But when my body starts to feel what I can only describe as immense pleasure & tingling during a hold, (about 1:30-2:00 in) it's almost as if fear, anxiety etc.. makes me inhale and I always feel like I could have done a little more. I'm afraid I'll pass out, and my brain, no matter what I do, goes into what I like to call, ""INHALE NOW"" mode. Like a subconscious, uncontrollable, state of panic, or fear, that I feel, if I kept going, I would be forcing it. As we all know Wim says ""NO FORCING!""  But would I be? Really? Or is that a trick or the mind??? 

After all this time, I feel like it's finally time to get past it, and hit that 3 minute mark. ANY help or advice to improve the times is super appreciated, and I'm very grateful for your help. 

And if it's a lot to type out or anything like that, I'm down to have a voice conversation maybe on Instagram? I dunno. I'll leave it to you guys. Let me know. And thank you in advance for your time and help. 

And if anyone wants any other info before answering, I'd be happy to reply with whatever you want to know. 

Thank you all! 
All the love, all the power. ❤","[""I'm sorry that I don't know the answer to your question. I just want to say that I appreciate your sharing your experience.

I train Wim Hof breathing now daily for over 90 days and I barely reach the 1,5 min mark breath holding. I never got longer than that.

"An important note to any anxiety sufferers like me (and anyone else who may be breathing wrong):
Even if your belly is expanding as you breathe, you may still be breathing shallowly. It's easy to move it without actually using the diaphragm. Your rib cage and lower back are also supposed to feel the breath and expand just a little. If it's been a while after last breathing properly, the sensation may even make you giggle.

"Good day random breathers...
I started doing the breathing and cold showers three weeks ago.
Reaching 60, doctors prescribe medication/poison to treat my autoimmune issues. Which I know are just masking the symptoms and in fact in time will create more problems.
I put medication aside and since practicing no flaring of symptoms and actually much improvement.
Holding breath I only manage 1.30.... but it's not a race.
Feeling the energy buzzing through my body, and knowing I control my health.

"To  be honest I find the frequency of in & out quite stressful and about 15-20% off. My body is not able to really take enough air in in this time, even when trying to get as much air in i still feel there is still 10% room i don't use but if Wim tells me to breath out i feel very stressed because when i'd use 'my personal rhythm i'd loose synchronisation. Can't tell, but i'd update the videos an use a more quiet music throughout the whole thing. When I'd taken my first 1-2 sessions some years ago I felt an overwhelming sensation in the end of the session i've never been feeling again. I miss this but maybe it has to do with the state of ones mental situation and ability to focus instead of still thinking of all the problems and bad things in one's life that seem to be around throughout the days ...",[],2023-03-18T06:19:18Z,@dickbrett9827

"It's not just to be relaxed.
It's to INDUCE Flow State as well, You can get meaning of life on your command by doing Wim Hof Method.
1) it's exhausting, so in usual situation like working and social interaction (outside of breathing session), You'd better off just getting satisfied with yourself, You can induce Flow on command, you could be very proud of it. This fact make you relaxed and focused on your life.
2)When you want to take massive risk Wim Hof Method tend to help you, supreme elation like Flow help you getting on some actions that require courage.
3) As far as I know, detail of this breathing method can be ignored, I think it depends on situation and your predisposition. I don't fully follow rules put out by Wim Hof and other people and still can get relaxed or can induce Flow. I follow the big part of rules, sequence of breathing. Fully in, and longer easier exhale X times, after X times, exhale and suffocate myself to the limit(or few steps away from actual limit, You MUST FEEL MASSIVE ANXIETY if you're healthy), and inhale, and stop breathing for relatively short period of time in comparison with limit of my hold time.","['@iceman_hof is currently giving out his private contact to few of his selected lucky fans , so you have been selected as one of those lucky fans.']",2023-03-17T04:59:18Z,@takahshi8993

"Hi just want to ask advuce from you lot. So I did this exercise, I'm new so just rewinded and did the short cycle x3. But at the end I got a headache on my left side. Should I be worried? I kinda forced myself in the last cycle to hold breath. 
Is this normal to anyone else and does it get better. I did feel calm during the hold and now my body feels cool.

"Lots of interesting comments here. I have to say something and have few questions 

- I have been doing swimming since 3+ months now. I used to have headaches almost every monday although not that serious. But since i started swimming, i have never seen headache again. Looks like my immunity has increased. 
- From the comments, it is clear that swimming is same as wim hof + cold showers because in swimming, you do alot of proper breathing and at the same time, you are in water(morning cold water) for almost an hour. So i can indirectly testify that wim hof + cold showers is an amazing combination.

My question to wim hof practitioners 

-has anyone fixed migraine with wim hof AND/OR cold showers?
- how cold should the water be to call it a cold shower?","['well, for the second question, in my opinion as long as you feel the urge to opt out or not get in the water means its cold enough.

"I have struggled with anxiety and what our society calls ‘ADHD’ for all of my life. After the first few days of doing this breathing and taking cold showers, my entire hormonal balance reset and for the first time ever, I experienced life in a regulated way - not too happy, not too sad…no matter the external stimulus. I always knew adhd wasn’t actually a disorder - it is a coping mechanism that some of us develop to deal with trauma in early childhood as a way of disconnecting from the damaging input. After over a month of doing the WHM, I experience emotional regulation almost all of the time no matter what. I have drastically lower anxiety levels, and I have even kicked a cold as it was starting to develop after 24 hours of travel with a slightly weakened immune system. 2 days of breathing and cold showers and no trace of the cold is left and I feel amazing. Big pharma does not want anyone doing this because it literally creates wellness, happiness, independence and freedom from drug dependency, which is terrible for their profits of course. @Wim, you are what the people of the world needed to get us through these challenging times and to be able to discern truth from the thousands and thousands of lies being told to us every day about our own health and our control over it. Every human being has the ability to overcome disease and we do not need pharmaceutical drugs to do it, you have proved it. The power is within…and always has been. This is what the yogis have always been telling us. This is why Buddhist monks can control their body temperature and heart rate as well. THIS is the truth of our existence as a species. From the bottom of my heart and I think everyone that has experienced what you have given us would agree…you have my eternal gratitude for sharing your love and this beautiful method with the world.

I heard of this technique quite a while ago and always wanted to try it out. I started already two times and got somehow scared when everything tingled and my ears where ringing during the breath holding periods. Have finished it the first time today and went over this feeling of fear and tried to accept the feelings of my body. At the end I teared up and have felt a brief strong connection to myself. Definitely want to try it again and am curious what will happen. Struggling with fear and anxiety since a long time and I want to overcome it. I want to feel relaxed and like 100% myself again.

"I've been doing this for about 6 months now at least once a week. I think it's good to find your own personal alterations. I've noticed that I get really dizzy if I do the 1 minute hold for the first one, so I hold for 1:30. I also like to take a few Pranayama breaths in between each set to allow the lungs to relax. For the third breath I hold for 2 minutes. I also sit up in a meditation position for the breaths and lie down for the holds.
    The benefits I've noticed include an almost complete reduction in asthma symptoms, which were pretty minor to begin with. Better lung health while running, such as a higher threshold of breathlessness. And a slight increase in the ability to breathe through my nose. In addition to that, I noticed mood improvement and a quicker digestion immediately after. Better mental clarity and reduced anxiety. Additionally I found that these breaths can be used as a pre-oxigenation method for exercise.",[],2023-02-14T23:55:49Z,@elliottlowrance4252

"I practice this breathing exercise every day since I've discovered it. After doing it for a few months I can now achieve nearly a two minute hold on the second and third rounds. I challenge myself to try and go a few more seconds every time I do it. I've recommended it to all my close friends and family. Every time I tell people that it involves holding your breath for 90 seconds after a full exhale they don't believe it is possible. 

I've developed anxiety in the last few years that manifests physical symptoms in my heart, and I'll experience rapid or pounding heartbeats while I'm not doing anything physical. It's miserable and scary. Any time I'm feeling some of this anxiety, or can't seem to calm my heart rate even though I'm just sitting at my desk, I will do this breathing exercise. It helps every single time, without fail. I close my eyes while I do it, and just feel my body existing in the present moment. I still struggle with anxiety, and out of all the strategies I've tried using to fight it, this breathing has been the most helpful for calming myself in the moment.

Maybe someone out there can relate to this. I'm so glad I found this video, and will continue my attempts to share this wonderful experience with as many people as I can.","['Yes, me too.', 'you are not alone, i’ve been dealing with heart palpatations and skipping beats although i live a healthy life and am an athlete. doctors could not find any physical disorders and prescripted antidepressants. been using them for 3 months but even though they seemed to help, palpatations was not fully gone. i started doing wim hof breathing 2 weeks ago and i only feel my hearth beating maybe a total of 30 mins in the day. im so happy.', 'update after 6 days: i now discovered there is such thing called hearthphobia and my symptoms are really similar to it. as far as i understand it is caused by stress and anxiety. my symptoms are nearly gone as i learned this phobia. i admitted to myself that i was wrong about my feelings and accepted what my doctor told me. i’m super fine now. i recommend researching this term “hearthphobia” to those who have the symptoms', ""I'm 65 yrs and had this since teenage yrs,,, my resting heart rate would jump to double for no reason then eventually go to normal just as quick.

Have you continued taking the antidepressants the doctors recommended? Have they helped?\n\nMy doctors have suggested various anxiety and antidepressant medication, but I am hesitant to start any of them because I've never taken prescriptions medications in my life.\n\nI still have the palpitations and skipping beats, even though I am a very fit and active person.

Daily practice of deep breathing is the key whether you hold for 15 seconds or 3 minutes.

"I’ve been doing this breathing exercise for over 2 years now and it’s the best thing I’ve ever introduced into my daily routine. I start my day by doing this exercise and it allows me to start the day calm, motivated and full of energy. I have been able to achieve so much more than I thought I could with the help of this video. Don’t get me wrong, life can still be challenging, but this exercise allows me to stay grounded and face any challenges, with belief that I have the resources to find solutions to the obstacles thrown in my path and if not, to accept what I can’t change, which is something I was struggling with a couple of years ago. I read and ‘like’ comments every day after finishing the exercise and I’m so happy and grateful to be a part of this community. I feel blessed that this video is available to us, allowing us to boost ourselves a little everyday. Thank you Wim Hof for making this practice widely available!

"Thank You for bringing this to Us! 
There are many charlatans out there, claiming to know the truth when ultimately, they just lead one astry. There are very view legitimate short cuts, especially concerning fitness, health and well-being - I understand this is one of them!

Sure, You can dive into vast ocean of all the different yoga practises, but learning to swim in these strange tides and not drowning due to the overwhelming size of it was to big of challenge, at least for me. 

As always, as new system towards growth arose on the horizon of my consciousness, those age-old questions that a lot of other folks are also just too familiar with, in some way or another, started to become the usual distraction once more: 
- ""How long do I need to do this, until it pays of?""
- ""Isn't there a more effective method?""
- ""Does it really work, at all?""
- ""Are there even any real benefits and if so, how good is the return on investment?""

For fifeteen years, I've been suffering from day time fatigue, for which no medical reason could be found. I've tried everything. I've. Tried. Everything! 
Nothing of which seemed to help at all. Until I discovered, that Yoga had to offer a wee bit more than just an excuse to go daydrinking for bored, suburban wives, that is. 
Simple Asanas focused on the core (i.e. lungs) coupled with the Wim Hof Method did the trick. It may be a strange way to end a paragraph this abruptly, however it symbolises how experietially my problems vanished figuratively with the snap of a finger. 

Again, Thank You for sharing Your method with Us! 
With Your reissuing of fire breathing, sometimes I wonder:

Quantum physics and gnostic texts (the most critical parts have been edited to misguide us from realizing the truth of our reality) are stating that atoms have no solidity at all, thus, it's impossible for our universe to be solid.  Why?  It's all in our mind.  Just like a computer that displays images and sound from wifi frequency, our mind body is literally a biological ""computer"" decoding tiny sliver of emf frequency being forced upon us by the Demiurge to enslave our mind.  Our perception has been hijacked and we are simply used as sustenance for low vibrational 4th dimensional beings.  Look at how inverted everything is.  Look at how everything is structured to produce low vibrations.  Money created from thin air in the form of numbers are loaned out with yet again, another set of imaginary numbers called ""interest"" to put us in perpetual servitude and low vibrational emotions (fear, anxiety, anger)  and victims to the banks taking money out of circulation to put us out of our homes.  Monsanto poisoning our food with sperm-killing-estrogen inducing food into our bodies.  Doctors making their patients get the fake covid vaccine and dousing our internal organs and blood with graphene oxide (fortunately most people received saline solution.  Can't have everyone dropping dead...).

Doctors destroy health.  Lawyers destroy the law.  Government destroys the people.  Everything is inverted.  Inversikn = Archontic = Evil",[],2023-01-27T00:56:07Z,@taemeister9302

"Wtf!???? That was only 11 minutes????

I hadn't done cardio but maybe once last month and before that not since August 2021.
Been feeling quite emotionally messed up the last couple months. Things are environment better day to day than they were from 2018 to the end of 2021.

Just pushed myself through a painful 5 mile run with a short break in the middle.

Laid on my floor when I got inside and followed this video. First time guided breathing.. cried off and on through the whole thing and while writing this. 

I went to a yoga class last month with my wife.. some kind of hot yoga power flow routine... Same thing there too! Starting half way through the class and growing in intensity.. except I couldn't stop crying after the class for probably 30 minutes.

How broken am I?

"This is the same method used to Restart a phone or a computer

breathing: 0:21

Closing all apps ,
 emptying all ram data ,
 clearing cache files,

Holding breath: 1:58
.
 letting the components cool down, and engage it's resting current flow, screen is off.
.
(a component never truly stops working until you pull out the plug or battery)

Full breath hold: 2:58

Basically turning on the device with the power button.
.
I don't think this action will fix any of your problems if you have ""damaged components""
.
But I believe it will give your brain enough ram data storage to troubleshoot your problem,

And if your brain is capable of commanding a ""cure"" or commanding a function to work properly
 
( like opening an app with no lag or slow internet) 

then that's where the ""healing"" happens.

I would recommend to

"I did this for the first now.
you got to know, I’m in a bad place mentally and emotionally right now. 

I was addicted to Cocaine for 8 Years and to stop me from Coke I did Oxy’s as well and you surely know how that ended, it lead my Cocaine Addiction right to another.

I was about to end my life because I couldnt handle that Pain and this suffering.

I couldn’t even cry anymore because my Body and my Mind became numb at that point, I couldn’t feel myself anymore. 

3 Months ago I decided to give it a last try and went to rehab.
Good News, I’m sober since that day but I’m struggling ever since to stay strong.




My Life is upside down, I can’t go to work because of the early stages where I’m right now in Therapy (I’m working in a big finance Company, so you know drugs are very welcome to keep you working 70hrs+)



Even though I’m doing the right thing, I’m absolutely stressed and insecure/unsure how my Life will ever be normal again 

Today, after the first Breathing Lesson, I felt something I haven’t felt for a long time, peace of mind. 

Right after that I began to cry uncontrollably, it almost felt like all of that Trauma and Sadness i’ve been holding for years ,bursting right out of my Body.




I know I still have a long way to go, but it’s the first time that I’m feeling ready for what’s coming. 


Thank you Wim❤

Am prone to stress and panic and I love the idea to gain control and be well. Is it possible for me if I follow your above breathing technique ? Can holding the breath lead to blood pressure rise ?

Thanks Aditi","['My advice to you is to consult a doctor about any worries of blood pressure. He can do tests for you. As for these exercises, the point of them is in fact to stress your body and become more resilient to stress overall, as you will strengthen your nervous system doing it, thus becoming more calm. There is a scientific basis in this, so its not quackery. Exposing yourself to cold also does a lot of things for your mind and body, and the breathing helps you cope with the stress of the cold, so its doubly beneficial.

"There are 4 types of breathing exercises. # 3 is a circle breathing - for (riding the earths polarity)!  Your technique is close. Don't fill or empty the lungs all the way. Fill the lungs 80/90%, empty 80/90%. This prevents clinching when (Impaled) with the earths polarity, while meditation.  Try #4,...... (Hyperventilation) A short quick half a lungs breath in / No pause/ a full lungs breath out. Slight pause then repeat. This super oxygenates the brain and FORCES kundalini energy from the base of the spine upwards, which opens the pineal gland and forces the lungs and blood to remove double the carbon dioxide on the breath out. No bag,.. no passing out.
Great when dealing with pain and suffering. Kundalini activation can be deadly when (Emotions are powering Hyperventilation),... !(HART STOPPING)!  Have hyperventilated for two weeks straight before,.... twice, with a week reprieve in da middle.  Try three days-(Three days of darkness) This is Kriya yoga 101.

"Hello to all, 

This breath session  ( and the cold shower changed my life) 

I am a person with my own path ( like everyone here ), I have huge problems with my focus, chronic anxiety, ( Thinking about death, metaphysical thinking ) organizational problems.

I started practicing a year and a half  ago, and the changes are AMAZING 

Since then, I have only been sick once (COVID which I solved in 2 days probably with the Wim Hof method?)
The state of mind has been tested (Courage, leaving comfort, fear management, anxiety blocking), better management of the unconscious 
Physically I tested, I have on average twice as much energy with, I run twice as much with a breath before than without.
Able to manage strokes and their pain with the method, resists more easily to some cold. 

My learning difficulties I think double, more organization of the concentration, better management of the anxiety 


Personally I use the method in my own way, I practice 1 cycle every half hour (especially when I work or when I need to concentrate)
and 2 to 3 cycles every 1H30 

Guaranteed effect  



Take care of yourself!","['Nice, keep going 😀', 'Amazed to read this 👍👍👍👍', 'Take care your loved', ""I am a big advocate of breathing techniques and meditation in general..

"Wim Hof, from my whole heart, thank you so much for your guidance and sharing your wisdom. Your breathing exercises have helped me so much. Years ago I had eaten an edible that got me way too high, so high that I forgot how to breathe, and it scared me beyond comprehension. I haven’t quite been the same since, and I’ve been dealing with anxiety and trouble breathing every day. Then one day, I said this is enough, and I searched for answers and came across your videos. I thank the Lord for this, as it has changed my life. My anxiety is going away. I can now breathe and not be afraid of breathing. I do your guided breath work twice a day, and I’m so grateful. Every day I grow stronger and every day I feel that trauma being released and getting smaller.

"Expert and advanced knowledge and advice:

Here’s what everybody’s missing about the Wim Hof method which Wim discussed in his more beginner friendly video which is less popular than this one. The reason why everybody quits this and don’t do it anymore like me. The missing link. You’re all doing it wrong, forgetting to follow the basics. This breathing method and video is supposed to be hard to do and not easy, because this is what Wim used to conquer world recorlds, so this world class technique needs world class users too, to achieve its full potential’s benefits. So if you think or feel that this is too easy, slow, or calm for you, then you’re doing it wrong, as you’re supposed to be heated up and tired/dizzy doing this. You’re supposed to inhale ‘till you can’t anymore, or fully in, then just exhale normally or how your body would exhale by itself, while following the time or the orange circle blob enlarging. At the largest point means you’ve also already inhaled fully in, then out following the circle shortening. You can do this nose, mouth or both, it doesn’t matter, as evidence you can hear Wims breathing through his mouth while the guy in his pushup video did it in his nose. So in short, the desired effects from this, makes you tired and heated up.",[],2022-11-28T09:11:15Z,@kvfk8917

"After 1 year, and then some, of the method here are my results:

1.Nasal congestion is still uncomfortable but I can breath through my nostrils. Before, I was addicted to nasal spray for 4 years and it was the ONLY way I could breath. I can breath!

2. I haven't gotten since starting. No allergies, no colds, no debilitating sore throats. Before I would get sick with the seasons and when I would eat bad food. Though, I have gotten sick once. When I smoked half a pack of cigarettes in one night. No sickness except maybe lil bug in my throat for a night every season.

3. It has created a discipline in my life that's easy and beneficial. It has given me the ability to know I can do other things. 

4. It helps me manage my depression. It hasn't been a cure for me, and other factors play in , but I'm a lil happier after I do it.

5. My work capacity has greatly increased. I helped my friends move once and thats when I realized. I was completely outperforming the others guys. One was the dad of the friend and the other was her brother. Just seeing them sweat and heave to keep up was profound to me.

All in all I'm going another year to see what else I can do!","['Amazing!! Have you tried cold showers?', 'Good job! All the power, all the love ❤']",2022-11-25T18:35:54Z,@mememe1468
